human-activity-recog
====================

This is the code repository for the Course Project from the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.  The goal of the project was to take a dataset called Human Activity Recognition Using Smart Phones and clean and transform the data into a tidy dataset.

Dataset
====================

The data used in this project was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Project Files
=====================

This project contains the following files:

* run_analysis.R:  Main code file that contains the code to perform the data transformations and produce the final tidy dataset.

* CodeBook.md:  File that describes the dataset and the transformations that were made on the dataset.
